# Anime Detour

The official Anime Detour iOS application.

## Requirements

The app is written in Swift 2. Xcode 7 or later is required to compile it.

## Analytics

The app uses Google Analytics. To get started, copy `GoogleAnalyticsConfiguration.plist.dist`, rename it to `GoogleAnalyticsConfiguration.plist`, and set your Google Analytics tracking ID. To run the app without analytics, remove the placeholder analytics ID. Analytics are not tracked in the Debug configuration.

## Deployment

Before deploying, increment the build number of the app by one. Open `Anime Detour.xcworkspace` in Xcode, select the `Anime Detour` project in the Navigator pane, select the `Anime Detour` target in the main editor, and change the build number.

Use [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) to manage metadata, including the App Store description and screenshots. All `fastlane` commands should be run from the root of the repo. See `fastlane/README.md` for installation instructions and helpful links.
